# Introduction and economic setup

* Response variables
+ **: 
* Treatment variables
+ **:  
* Covariates
+ *sex*: Indicator variable where $= 1$ indicates male

Below, we load the data as a .csv file, rename the response and the treatment variable to $Y$ and $W$, respectively, and extract the relevant covariates outlined above. Then, we standardize the continuous covariates to have zero mean and unit variance and omit observations with _NA_ entries.


```r
# Clear any existing variables
rm(list = ls())

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1995)

# Load data
data_raw <- read.csv('/Users/Markichi/Documents/PhDECON/TSL/data/FRS_2017_16.csv')

# These are the covariates we'll use
cts_variables_names <- c("yob")
binary_variables_names <- c("sex")
covariates <- c(cts_variables_names, binary_variables_names)
all_variables_names <- c(covariates)

# Selecting only desired covariates
data_subset <- data_raw %>%
    dplyr::select(all_variables_names)
```

```
## Error: Unknown columns `yob` and `sex`
```

```r
# Extracting and scaling continuous variables
scaled_cts_covariates <- data_subset %>%
    dplyr::select(cts_variables_names) %>%
    scale()
```

```
## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'data_subset' not found
```

```r
# Extracting indicator variables
binary_covariates <- data_subset %>%
    dplyr::select(binary_variables_names)
```

```
## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'data_subset' not found

```r

outcome <- data_subset %>% dplyr::select(outcome_voted)
```

```

```

```r
treatment <- data_subset %>% dplyr::select(treat_neighbors)
```

```
## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'data_subset' not found

```r
# Setting up the data, renaming columns and discarding rows with NA (if any)
df <- data.frame(scaled_cts_covariates, binary_covariates, outcome, treatment) %>%
    plyr::rename(c(treat_neighbors = "W",
                   outcome_voted = "Y")) %>%
    na.omit()
